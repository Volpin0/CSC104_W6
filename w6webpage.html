                    <li>This is the classic D-pad design.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Consists of a single piece of plastic molded into a cross shape with four directions (up,
                        down,left, right).</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>The design has been widely adopted and imitated in various forms by other console manufacturers.

                    <br>
                    <li>The circle can be more comfortable for some players as it allows for smoother circular movements
                        and diagonal directions.
